                <p>
                    Invictus Gaming became the 2018 League of Legends World Champions in emphatic fashion on Saturday,
                    taking a clean 3-0 sweep over Fnatic at Munhak Stadium in Incheon, South Korea.
                </p>
                <p>2018 has been a tumultuous year in League of Legends. Dynasties have come crumbling down in Korea,
                    with this year's World Championship hosts unable to cheer on a native team in the finals for the
                    first time since Season 1. In the West, hope remains as Europe and North America combined to make up
                    three out of the four semifinal teams. Above all else, though, 2018 will go down as the year of the
                    League of Legends Pro League, with China winning every major LoL tournament of the year. Though
                    China's dominance was a major storyline coming into Worlds, few expected the team to carry the LPL
                    banner in the finals to be Invictus Gaming, a squad that has historically failed to achieve any
                    domestic success.</p>
                <p>Although Invictus dropped games against Fnatic earlier in the group stage, the iG that took to
                    Summoner's Rift looked a far cry away from the team that began the tournament. Throughout its run
                    through the bracket, Invictus Gaming looked nye-unstoppable, running through teams thanks to its
                    transcendent talent in the solo lanes, and that trend continued against Fnatic. Top laner Kang
                    "TheShy" Seung-lok continued to terrorize his opponents in lane, making an example of Fnatic's
                    rookie top, Gabriël "Bwipo" Rau by imposing his will on the top side of the map. Meanwhile, mid
                    laner Song "Rookie" Eui-jin proved that he was the best player in the Finals, consistently winning
                    his mid lane matchup and roaming around the map, getting his bottom lane involved early and often as
                    iG dictated the pace of each game.</p>
                <p>
                    It wasn't just iG's solo lanes that performed well, though. Jungler Gao "Ning" Zhen-Ning, who was
                    seen as a Xin Zhao and Camille two-trick earlier in the tournament, picked up a Finals MVP for his
                    shutout performance vs Fnatic, dominating Game 2 as Gragas and consistently getting TheShy ahead
                    very early into the game. AD carry Yu "JackeyLove" Wen-Bo went toe-to-toe with EU all-star Martin
                    "Rekkles" Larsson and shined, carrying iG in later-game teamfights. Invictus Gaming stayed true to
                    itself and each other in all three games, surging ahead of Fnatic through clever early ganks and raw
                    talent. Facing doubters throughout its entire worlds run, iG proved that not only is the LPL
                    currently the best region in the world, but that Invictus Gaming can be overlooked no longer.
